# Chess Opening Moves

A simple app using [Chessboardjsx](https://chessboardjsx.com/) and
[Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) to give users the ability to select opening chess
moves and explore variations through drag and drop.

Planning to eventually add explanations about the strategies behind each of the openings and
instructions that users can follow to learn variations.
